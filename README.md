# VCellChatBot

Predictive mathematical modeling is an essential part of systems biology and is interconnected with information management. Systems biology information is stored in specialized formats [http://co.mbine.org](http://co.mbine.org) that facilitate data storage and analysis (e.g. [http://sbgn.org](http://sbgn.org), [http://sbml.org](http://sbml.org)). These formats are not designed for easy human readability and thus require specialized software to visualize and interpret results. There is an RDF/XML schema for storage of each type of data. Traditionally, to understand this data, you need specific tools that perform a specific set of queries. AI allows users to explore different type of data directly [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-025-00496-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-025-00496-z). We prototyped a [ChatGPT chatbot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-n3asZvWaM-vcell-models-explorer) to explore VCell models [http://vcell.org](http://vcell.org). The design of the Chatbot is described in the following [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jLNjl-ZxZDeGcRxVL754Oao4GYsM4u0Y/view). It is using [VCell API](https://vcell.cam.uchc.edu/api/v0/biomodel).
